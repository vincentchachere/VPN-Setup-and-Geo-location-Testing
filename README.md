<h1 align="center">VPN Setup and Geo-Location Testing</h1>

In this lab, you will set up a virtual machine in Azure, test internet geolocation from different regions, and configure a VPN to explore how it affects online location and browsing experiences. You will also learn to manage Azure resources and observe the impact of VPN connections on websites and services.

<h1 align="center">Lab Overiew (Image above Explained)</h1>

1. Visit https:whatismyipaddress.com from our personal computer
2. Create a VM and connect via RDP
3. Access https:whatismyipaddress.com from the VM
4. Install and connect to a VPN on the VM
5. Revisit https:whatismyipaddress.com from the VPN

<h1 align="center">What is a VPN?</h1>

A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is a secure connection that encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a server in another location, masking your IP address and making your online activities more private.  

**Example:** If you're in the U.S. and connect to a VPN server in Japan, websites will see your location as Japan, allowing access to region-specific content while keeping your data secure.

**VPN Metaphor Example:** A VPN is like a secure tunnel for your internet traffic. Imagine sending a letter through a courier that hides the sender‚Äôs address and replaces it with their own. The recipient sees the courier's address, not yours, keeping your identity private and secure.

<h2 align="center">Final Thoughts</h2>

This lab demonstrated how VPNs can enhance online privacy, mask your location, and provide access to region-specific content. By setting up a virtual machine in Azure and testing a VPN, we explored the practical impacts of geolocation changes and gained hands-on experience with cloud resources and VPN configuration. These skills are essential for understanding network security, privacy, and global connectivity in today‚Äôs digital world.
